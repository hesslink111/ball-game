# Ball Game

### Description

A 2d platform bouncing-ball game based on the mechanics of [N-Ball](http://www.ragdollsoft.com/nball/). The player controls a ball and has the ability to jump and apply force to the ball in any direction. The purpose of the game is to avoid obstacles while moving the ball through the level to the final platform. The fun of the game comes from the physics engine and interacting with the objects in the map.

This project uses the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) game library for graphics physics (libgdx uses [Box2D](http://box2d.org/)), and Google's [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for deserialization of map files.
